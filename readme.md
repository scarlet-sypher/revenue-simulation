*Run "what-if" scenarios on your Q3 revenue — powered by real Q1 & Q2 sales data* 🚀

</div>

---

## 📋 What Problem Does It Solve?

Sales teams often ask questions like: *"If we close deals 20% faster, how much more do we earn?"* or *"What happens to revenue if average deal size drops by 10%?"*

This engine answers those questions. It reads your historical deal data, builds a Q3 baseline projection from Q1 & Q2 patterns, and lets you apply scenario changes — seeing the revenue impact week by week, instantly.

### 🌟 What Makes It Useful
- **Real data-driven projections** — no hardcoded assumptions, everything comes from your CSV
- **Three levers to pull** — conversion rate, deal size, and sales cycle
- **Instant visual feedback** — baseline vs scenario chart updates on demand
- **Plain-English insights** — explains *why* revenue changed, not just by how much

## ⚙️ How It Works

Here's the full flow from raw CSV to revenue insight:

### 1️⃣ Load & Split Data
All deals are read from `deals.csv`. Each deal is classified into Q1, Q2, or Q3 based on its `closed_date` (or `created_date` for open deals).

- **Q1** → January to March
- **Q2** → April to June
- **Q3** → July to September *(open deals without a close date)*

### 2️⃣ Compute Historical Metrics (from Q1 + Q2)

| Metric | Formula |
|---|---|
| **Conversion Rate** | `Won Deals / (Won + Lost Deals)` |
| **Avg Deal Size** | `Total Value of Won Deals / Won Deal Count` |
| **Avg Sales Cycle** | `Average days from created_date to closed_date` |

### 3️⃣ Build Q3 Weekly Buckets
Q3 pipeline deals are grouped into **12 weekly buckets** — 4 weeks each for July, August, and September.

### 4️⃣ Run Simulation
For each of the 12 weeks:

```
Baseline Revenue  = deals_in_bucket × conversion_rate × avg_deal_size

Scenario Revenue  = deals_in_bucket
                  × cycle_multiplier      ← from sales cycle change
                  × new_conversion_rate   ← from conversion change
                  × new_deal_size         ← from deal size change
```

> `cycle_multiplier = original_cycle / new_cycle` — a shorter cycle increases revenue velocity.

### 5️⃣ Compute Impact
```
Absolute Impact   = Scenario Total - Baseline Total
Percentage Impact = (Absolute Impact / Baseline Total) × 100
```

### 6️⃣ Generate Insight
> *"Revenue increased by 58.2% due to higher conversion rate (+10%), larger average deal size (+15%), and shorter sales cycle (-5 days)"*

---

## 📐 Key Metrics Explained

**Conversion Rate**
The share of deals ending as "Closed Won" out of all closed deals. Higher conversion = more pipeline turning into actual revenue.

**Average Deal Size**
The mean value of all won deals. Even a small increase compounds significantly across the entire Q3 pipeline.

**Sales Cycle**
Average days from deal creation to close. A shorter cycle means deals resolve faster — same deal count, more revenue velocity. Modelled as a ratio multiplier.

---

## 🧮 Example Calculation

Assume Q1/Q2 gives us these baseline metrics:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Conversion Rate | 40% (0.4) |
| Avg Deal Size | ₹50,000 |
| Avg Sales Cycle | 30 days |

Week 1 of Q3 has **20 deals in the bucket**.

**Baseline Revenue (Week 1):**
```
20 × 0.4 × 50,000 = ₹4,00,000
```

Apply: Conversion +10%, Deal Size +5%, Sales Cycle -3 days

```
New Conversion Rate  = 0.4 × 1.10  = 0.44
New Deal Size        = 50,000 × 1.05 = ₹52,500
Cycle Multiplier     = 30 / 27      = 1.111

Scenario Revenue:
20 × 1.111 × 0.44 × 52,500 = ₹5,13,513
```

**Week 1 Impact: +₹1,13,513 (+28.4%)**

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v18+
- **npm** or yarn
- **Git**

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scarlet-sypher/revenue-simulation.git
cd revenue-simulation
```

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `server/`:
```env
PORT=5000
```

Place your `deals.csv` file inside the `server/` directory, then start:
```bash
npm run dev
```

API runs at → `http://localhost:5000`

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `client/`:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Start the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open → `http://localhost:5173`

### 4️⃣ Access the App

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| Backend API | http://localhost:5000 |
| Simulate Endpoint | http://localhost:5000/api/simulate |

---

## 🗄️ Environment Variables

| Variable | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `server/.env` | Port for the Express server |
| `VITE_API_URL` | `client/.env` | Base URL pointing to the backend |

---

## 📋 deals.csv Format

```
deal_id, created_date, closed_date, stage, deal_value, region, source
```

- `stage` → `"Closed Won"` or `"Closed Lost"` for closed deals
- `closed_date` → can be empty for open/in-progress deals
- Dates → parseable format (e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD`)

---

## 📌 Assumptions Made

- Q3 is July–September. Open deals (no `closed_date`) created in this window are treated as Q3 pipeline.
- Baseline metrics are computed from Q1 + Q2 closed deals only.
- The cycle multiplier models a linear relationship between cycle length and revenue velocity.
- Invalid or missing date rows are silently skipped.
- Slider inputs are clamped server-side regardless of frontend values.

---

## 🔀 Key Decisions & Trade-offs

**CSV over a database** — Keeps the project portable and dependency-free. A production version would pull live from a CRM API.

**Weekly buckets instead of daily** — Daily is too noisy on Q3 pipeline data. Weekly gives cleaner signal without losing meaningful granularity.

**Cycle multiplier as a ratio** — Converts sales cycle change into a velocity factor instead of adjusting deal counts directly, capturing throughput effects without simulating individual timelines.

**Server-side clamping** — Inputs are validated on the backend regardless of what the UI sends, keeping the simulation model within realistic bounds.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Single CSV data source only — no live CRM integration
- Linear model — doesn't account for seasonality or pipeline decay
- Q3 bucketing uses `created_date`, not projected close dates
- No auth or user sessions — single shared dataset
- Chart covers Q3 only (12 weeks) — no historical quarter view

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Connect to HubSpot / Salesforce API instead of CSV
- [ ] Region and source-level filtering for segment simulations
- [ ] Multi-quarter historical chart view
- [ ] Export simulation results as PDF or CSV
- [ ] Save and compare multiple scenarios side by side
- [ ] Confidence intervals based on historical variance
